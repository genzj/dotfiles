# dotfiles

This repo manages my dotfiles with [chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io/).

## Apply

1. For containers or other minimal env, following tools should be installed
before applying the dotfiles, e.g. on Ubuntu:

    ```sh
    sudo apt install -y git curl zsh tmux
    ```

1. Check [Tools](#tools) and install the tools which should **not** be
automatically installed.

1. One-liner to apply the dotfiles:

    ```sh
    sh -c "$(curl -fsLS get.chezmoi.io)" -- init --apply genzj
    ```

1. Or, manually apply it by:
    1. [Install chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io/install/)
    1. Apply the dotfiles by running `chezmoi init --apply genzj` ([ref](https://www.chezmoi.io/reference/commands/init/))

## Tools

The following tools will be automatically installed by running their
installation shell scripts. If you prefer using a package manager for
installation management instead of downloading the binary release, please
install them before applying the dotfiles.

1. [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/getting-started.html) will be automatically installed.
1. If ZIM is not desired, disable ZIM by change config `data.tool.zsh.use_zim`
to false, or following tools will be automatically installed
    - [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf?tab=readme-ov-file#installation)
    - [starship](https://starship.rs/guide/#%F0%9F%9A%80-installation).
    - [Zim](https://zimfw.sh/docs/install/)
    - [zoxide](https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide?tab=readme-ov-file#installation)
1. Following tools will be automatically installed if they are not found in the
PATH. The installation will be conducted by mise first and fallback to shell
script if mise exited with error
    - [bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat?tab=readme-ov-file#installation)
    - [fd](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd?tab=readme-ov-file#installation)
    - [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep)
    - lsd (no fallback)
    - zoxide (no fallback, unless using ZIM)

## Post Update Configurations

See `run_after_99-post-actions.zsh` for details.

1. If you use Ubuntu and install Zsh with apt, the script will add the following line to
    your `~/.zshenv` file to stop `/etc/zsh/zshrc` from calling `compinit`
    ([ref](https://github.com/zimfw/zimfw/wiki/Troubleshooting#completion-is-not-working)):

    ```sh
    skip_global_compinit=1
    ```

1. Rebuild bat theme cache
1. Reinstall Zim modules to make sure they are using the degit

## Other Planned Features

## Out of Scope (for now)

### NeoVIM and Neovide config

My [NeoVIM config](https://github.com/genzj/mynvim) contains the lazy lock file
which varies with different OS/host because not all plugins are enabled
everywhere. So chezmoi external system which is based on git-pull cannot always
successfully update the config folder which contains modified lazy-lock file.

Most of the Neovide customizations are also included in the mynvim repo as lua
scripts. Neovide [config file](https://neovide.dev/config-file.html) is for a
different set of configurations which I don't need to alter because their
default values works well for me. So it's not managed by this repo either.

## Troubleshooting

### `is-at-least` function error during `zimfw` execution

The function definition is missing in some "internal" patched zsh 5.x. Download
it from
[here](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh/blob/master/Functions/Misc/is-at-least)
and put it under the system-level zsh function folder.
